Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to

Bili NE! Survival Shop PRIVACY POLICY 02jun23
DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
privacy notice.

Yes, we will update our privacy policies as necessary from time to time to stay compliant
with relevant laws. The revised version will have the revision date, and will be effective
as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may
notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending
you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be
